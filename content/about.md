I'm a 23-year-old backend engineer who loves working with [Golang](https://go.dev) and [Python](https://www.python.org) to build solid web services. While I spend my days crafting efficient backend systems, my real passion lies in tinkering with low-level programming. You'll often find me messing around with newer languages like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), [Zig](https://ziglang.org), [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) for fun projects or diving into [C](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/gnu-c-manual.html) to build simple games using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com). It's not just about the code for me â€“ I'm fascinated by how things work under the hood.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably knee-deep in a cybersecurity challenge. I get a real kick out of solving [CTF](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)>)s and breaking into networks on platforms like [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu). It's more than just a hobby; it's a way to keep my skills sharp and approach my day job with a security-first mindset. I'm also pretty proud of co-founding **[initcrew](https://initcrew.com)**, a cybersecurity community in Kerala. We're all about sharing knowledge and helping each other level up in the world of infosec.

i have strong opinions and love to share my experiments and insights on technology, engineering, and cybersecurity. You can find my articles and projects [here](/blogs).
